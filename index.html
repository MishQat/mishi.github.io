      <h1>Autonomous Poker Dealer</h1>
      <p class="project-subtitle">Computer Vision • AI • Robotics Integration</p>

      <h2>My Role & Perspective</h2>
      <p>
        My contribution to this project was primarily focused on the <strong>mechanical design</strong>
        of the robotic arm. I joined the team at a relatively late stage, at a point where several
        key hardware components had already been ordered based on an earlier design direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        The original plan was to construct the arm largely from pre-made components. However,
        midway through the project, the design scope shifted toward a different arm configuration.
        At that point, I was tasked with designing a new mechanical layout using components that
        had been selected for a different concept, with limited briefing on the final intended
        architecture.
      </p>

      <h2>Design Constraints & Challenges</h2>

      <p>
        This meant working under unusually rigid constraints: I had to use the available motors,
        servos, and structural components while simultaneously imagining and defining how the arm
        should function geometrically and spatially. One of the key requirements was ensuring that
        the arm could reach across the full width of a poker table to deal cards reliably.
      </p>

      <p>
        To satisfy the reach requirement, the arm geometry necessarily became long and extended.
        While this met the workspace objective, it introduced a significant mechanical mismatch:
        the distal servo motors were <strong>too large and too heavy</strong> relative to their function,
        and the mass distribution placed excessive load on the base joint.
      </p>

      <h2>Why the System Failed</h2>

      <p>
        Although the arm could theoretically reach the required workspace when fully extended,
        the base servo was unable to support the combined weight and moment generated by the
        upstream motors and arm structure. In practice, the torque requirements exceeded what
        the base actuator could reliably deliver.
      </p>

      <p>
        In hindsight, the design failure was not caused by a single poor engineering decision,
        but by a <strong>system-level mismatch</strong> between actuator selection, mass distribution,
        and kinematic requirements. The servo motors did not need to be as bulky at the end effector,
        and a lighter, more hierarchical actuation strategy would have been more appropriate.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        From my perspective, the core issue was ultimately one of <strong>project management and scope
          alignment</strong>. There was a substantial disconnect between what components had been procured,
        what the final system was expected to do, and how those expectations evolved over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        This experience reinforced an important engineering lesson: even strong subsystem design
        cannot compensate for unclear requirements and late-stage scope changes. Mechanical systems,
        in particular, are far less forgiving to iteration than software or perception pipelines.
      </p>

      <h2>What’s documented</h2>
      <p>
        Since my local documentation is fragmented, the project story is best captured through three
        external artefacts:

      <h2>Key lessons</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Robotics is systems engineering:</strong> perception can be “correct” while hardware still fails.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Iteration speed matters:</strong> software iterations are cheap; mechanical iterations are
          expensive.</li>
        <li><strong>Engineering honesty wins:</strong> documenting failure properly is often more valuable than a demo.

      <h1 id="project2-title">DMT Gravity-Propelled Car</h1>
      <p class="project-subtitle">
        Mechanical Engineering • Design, Manufacture & Test
      </p>

      <img src="assets/images/project2.jpg" alt="DMT Car Assembly">

      <h2>Project Context</h2>

      <p>
        This project was a first-year <strong>Design–Make–Test (DMT)</strong> coursework assignment
        focused on designing and building a small gravity-propelled vehicle capable of travelling
        the full length of a 5&nbsp;m inclined track using only the energy from a falling mass.
      </p>

      <p>
        The brief intentionally imposed strict constraints on materials, components, and cost,
        closely mirroring real-world engineering scenarios where performance must be balanced
        against manufacturability and resource limitations.
      </p>

      <h2>My Role & Contributions</h2>

      <p>
        My primary responsibility within the group was the <strong>mechanical design and CAD modelling</strong>
        of the vehicle. This included designing the plywood chassis, assembling the drivetrain
        using pre-specified components, and producing detailed engineering drawings to support
        manufacture and assembly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although many components were industry-standard and pre-selected, the challenge lay in
        accurately modelling these parts from catalogue dimensions and integrating them into a
        coherent, mechanically sound assembly.
      </p>

      <h2>Engineering Challenges</h2>

      <p>
        The core engineering problem was converting gravitational potential energy into forward
        motion as efficiently as possible while minimising energy losses due to friction and
        wheel slip. This required careful consideration of gearbox ratios, wheel dimensions,
        axle loading, and overall mass distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        A key constraint was that once the plywood chassis was cut, its geometry could not be
        modified. This forced careful upfront design decisions regarding component placement
        and structural stability.
      </p>

      <h2>Analytical Approach</h2>

      <p>
        To guide design decisions, theoretical energy balance equations were used to estimate
        the vehicle’s final velocity. I implemented these calculations in a Python script,
        allowing rapid iteration over wheel sizes and gearbox ratios to identify suitable
        configurations before committing to manufacture.
      </p>

      <h2>Reflection & Key Lessons</h2>

      <p>
        While the project was relatively simple in scope, it highlighted how even small mechanical
        systems are governed by trade-offs between performance, robustness, and practicality.
        The experience reinforced the value of analytical modelling as a decision-making tool
        rather than a purely academic exercise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most importantly, this project served as an introduction to structured engineering
        thinking: defining constraints, justifying design choices, and accepting that optimal
        solutions often emerge from compromise rather than idealised theory.

        parameters quickly under constraints.

        <h2>Project Context</h2>

        <p>
          This project was a second-year mechanical engineering coursework assignment involving the
          complete mechanical design of a <strong>three-axis CNC positioning system</strong> intended
          for laser-based surface heat treatment of a cylindrical steel workpiece.
        </p>

        <p>
          The design brief imposed stringent performance requirements, particularly a maximum
          allowable elastic deflection of ±5&nbsp;µm per axis, placing stiffness rather than strength
          at the centre of the design process.
        </p>

        <h2>My Role & Contributions</h2>

        <p>
          Within the group, my contributions focused on <strong>structural design, component selection,
            and analytical validation</strong>. I was responsible for key load analyses, stiffness
          calculations, and the CAD modelling of several subsystems, including structural brackets
          and motion components.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also contributed to the production of detailed drawings and technical justification
          included in the final report, ensuring that design decisions were traceable and defensible.
        </p>

        <h2>Engineering Challenges</h2>

        <p>
          Unlike strength-governed designs, this system was dominated by elastic deformation limits.
          Even small geometric changes could result in deflections exceeding the permissible range,
          requiring careful iteration of cross-sections, spans, and support locations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Component selection further constrained the design: linear guides, lead screws, motors,
          and bearings had to be chosen from real catalogues, forcing trade-offs between stiffness,
          cost, availability, and dynamic performance.
        </p>

        <h2>Design Approach</h2>

        <p>
          The design process relied on simplified analytical models such as beam bending and
          plate deflection equations to guide early decisions before refinement in CAD.
          This approach enabled rapid elimination of unviable configurations prior to detailed modelling.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the design evolved, changes in one axis often propagated through the entire system,
          highlighting the interdependence inherent in multi-axis mechanical assemblies.
        </p>

        <h2>Reflection & Key Lessons</h2>

        <p>
          This project provided a realistic introduction to <strong>stiffness-limited mechanical design</strong>
          and demonstrated how tight performance tolerances can dominate system architecture.
          It also reinforced the importance of early analytical reasoning to reduce unnecessary
          iteration at later stages.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond technical skills, the project highlighted the value of clear documentation and
          structured justification when working within a team. The experience closely resembled
          early-stage industrial design work rather than a purely academic exercise.

      <h1>24-Hour Robotics Hackathon</h1>

      <p>
        This project was a high-intensity, 24-hour robotics hackathon where the task was to
        design and build a robot capable of transporting a sensor-equipped “toxic waste”
        barrel across an obstacle course under time pressure.
      </p>

      <p>
        The event emphasized rapid prototyping, teamwork, and pragmatic engineering decisions
        in a fast-paced environment. Our team had to ideate, fabricate, test, and iterate
        within a single day.
      </p>

      <h2>My Role & Contributions</h2>

      <p>
        I contributed directly to both the mechanical and systems aspects of the robot:
        I designed and assembled a stable DC-motor chassis, integrated an <strong>Arduino
          Uno</strong> with Bluetooth control for remote actuation, and developed a servo-powered
        claw and lifting mechanism using custom SolidWorks parts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mechanical subsystems — particularly the claw and elevator — were designed to
        handle variable loads with minimal complexity, balancing robustness and rapid manufacturability.
      </p>

      <h2>Action & Implementation</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Constructed a reliable mobile base using DC motors and lightweight structural
          materials to navigate the obstacle course.
        </li>
        <li>
          Programmed wireless control using an Arduino Uno and Bluetooth module, enabling
          responsive remote operation within the course constraints.
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed and fabricated servo-actuated claws and an elevator system in SolidWorks,
          iterating quickly to ensure effective grasping and lifting of the mock barrel.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Result & Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        By the end of the 24-hour period, our team delivered a functional rover featuring
        an innovative claw-and-elevator system capable of picking up and transporting the
        target object across terrain obstacles. The project was an excellent test of
        multidisciplinary integration under extreme time pressure.
      </p>

      <p>
        More than a completed robot, the event was a lesson in <strong>collaboration</strong>,
        rapid engineering decision-making, and resilience. Applying mechanical design
        principles in a constrained timeframe taught me a great deal about prioritising
        robustness over polish, anticipating failure modes quickly, and communicating
        effectively within a team.
      </p>

      <h2>Personal Insight</h2>

      <p>
        I shared a reflection on this experience on LinkedIn, where I discussed how the
