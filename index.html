    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This group Design–Make–Test project focused on developing a small,
      gravity-propelled vehicle capable of traversing a 5-metre inclined
      track using only the energy from a 2.5 kg falling mass.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project explored the practical application of energy transfer,
      drivetrain optimisation, and real-world engineering trade-offs
      between performance, durability, and manufacturing cost.
    </p>

    <h2>My Role & Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed the full vehicle assembly in CAD using premade component dimensions</li>
      <li>Created the plywood chassis design to serve as the primary structural element</li>
      <li>Imported and integrated standard components (bearings, fasteners, shafts)</li>
      <li>Produced detailed engineering drawings for manufacturing and assembly</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Engineering Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      A major constraint of the project was the use of predefined,
      industry-standard components, limiting geometric freedom while
      increasing the importance of accurate modelling and component
      selection.
    </p>

    <p>
      The drivetrain and gearbox design required balancing torque and
      speed to ensure sufficient traction on the incline while preventing
      wheel slip and excessive energy loss through friction.
    </p>

    <h2>Design Approach</h2>
    <p>
      The design process was guided by theoretical modelling of energy
      conversion from gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy.
      A Python script was developed to rapidly evaluate different wheel
      sizes and gearbox ratios, enabling efficient optimisation of the
      drivetrain configuration.
    </p>

    <h2>Outcome</h2>
    <p>
      The final vehicle successfully met the project constraints, achieving
      reliable performance across multiple test runs while maintaining
      structural integrity and manufacturability.
